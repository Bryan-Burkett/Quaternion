TestFile.rkt is empty except for requiring Quaternion.rkt and qreader.rkt. Use it to test our program.

Quaternion.rkt contains our quaternion calculator.
qreader.rkt contains the reader to allow interpretation of quaternions in standard notation.

Documentation.html is the documentation for our project.
styles contains all of the .css files for Documentation.html and must be in the same directory as Documentation.html

Enjoy!
