Abstract: 
I feel that the structure of the report should be a week by week basis of what we accomplished working towards the project.  
We can start from the assignment of the project to its finalization and go through each roles involvement during each step of the process.  
If anyone else has other suggestions, please list them here.


notable timeline of project events:
Week 1: no lab
1/21: Course began and project was assigned
1/23: Github account set up and created test module for quaternion.rkt
Week 2: introduction to racket
1/30: Added collaborators on Gitub so the whole team can edit
Week 3: Recursion and parsing lists
2/6: Barebones functions added for required operations
2/6: +, -, /, * all created along with make-quaternion function
2/8: * and / fixed and log function completed
Week 4: Modules and providing functions
2/10: exponential function completed and case exceptions began being tested
2/11: sin and cos taylor series approximation added
Week 5: outside of class meetings
2/19: attempted to overload operators by renaming the function calls
2/23: #guard feature added to structure as error checking mechanism
Week 6: Reader example
2/25: qreader.rkt created
2/26: reader parser completed
2/27: Remade sin and cos functions to Euler's formula instead of series approximation
2/28: streamlined qreader and quaternion files

(I will also be looking over old emails and the lab assignments to see what was done when) 

Overview: A basic description of the project involving the assignment objectives and requirements. Will be something short and sweet.
