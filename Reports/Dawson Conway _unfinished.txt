     I was a memeber of the documentation group for team 1 on the Quaternions project. I was responsible for the reference documentation. I had to document everything in our project in-depth. To do so I used Scribble, Racket's own documentation language. Scribble is based on Racket, but it uses slightly different syntax. We chose to use Scribble because it matches the already existing Racket documentation, allowing for a sense of consistancy. 
     The first challenge was learning how to use Scribble. It treats everything as text to be displayed unless it is prefixed with "@". It creates a table of contents automatically as well as most of the styles.
     Then I started documenting our project by going through the file and writing a summery for each procedure. I explained each argument and the output for each procedure as well as the process used to get that output. I also ended up organizing the code in our project itself. I re-ordered the functions so that the were grouped logically (quaternion-specific functions, basic operators and advanced operators). This allowed my documentation to explain procedures in the same order they appeared in the code, so that anyone reading the code could follow along in the documentation.
