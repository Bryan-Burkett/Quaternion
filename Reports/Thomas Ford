Thomas Ford
EECS 448 Project 1 Report

I was selected to be a Programmer as part of the program team with two others ; although I worked with the business team the most. We worked on figuring out the value and how to present our system to the class. I took the role of learning the code developed and helping translate the program functionality and syntax for the business team.  I planned and made an outline for the power point with the business team. Not only did we create the presentation but we also helped make the program customer friendly and easy to use.  Since most of the business personnel weren't well versed in racket previously I compared structure based program to a list base to accurately portray why we used structures in the presentation.  I also created the slide explaining the qreader.rkt and its functionality. Overall I spent a great deal of time creating the power point and helping billing to understand the code to properly sell our program.   
For the presentation, I kept it short and sweet with plenty of demo time mainly giving credits and explaining in a few slides what we did and how it makes our program the best of the best. 
As for writing the original code I was not a huge part of the effort so I decided to help organize and explain the code to the business team to make our presentation go smoothly and to make the presenters better informed. The billing/business team I worked with all helped in different ways making this project goes very smoothly.
